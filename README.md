README file for the project in the course Getting and Cleaning Data
===================================================================

This repo is intended to store the files for a learning project within the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data" 


There are three files:

* README.md: This file
* run_analysis.R: The R script implementing the project
* CodeBook.md: Data codebook with explanations of variables meaning, origin and transformations


The requirements for this project are:

- Download the provided dataset
- Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names. 
- Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


For explanation regarding the original dataset, the processing made by run_analysis.R, and the output format, please refer to CodeBook.md
